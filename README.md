# auto_analyze
This tool allows one to visualize two demonstration CSV files or upload a file. Use public data here, or clone and run locally if your dataset is private. 
The tool will help you analyze CSV files in Tidy format (explanation on the site) and allow interaction with ChatGPT if you have an api-key for openai. Local installation
with all packages should just "work" after installing all dependencies noted. See streamlit.io example here: https://data-auto-analysis.streamlit.app/
